Pneumonia
----------
Pneumonia is a health problem that accounts for a significant amount of patient morbidity and mortality (Gonçalves-Pereira, Conceição et al., 2013). Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications including death (Aydogdu et al., 2010) . Regions lacking professional expertise and healthcare resources are severely impacted by suboptimal clinical evaluation which result in missed diagnosis and excess morbidity and mortality. According to the Najwa Mekki of UNICEF, Pneumonia kills half a million children under five in sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for half of pneumonia deaths among children under five worldwide (Mekki, 2016).

Aim
----
The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning algorithm that is capable of diagnosing pneumonia infected patients from chest X-ray images, with the intention of increasing access to medical imaging expertise in regions where access to such resources is limited.
